### Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Planning
- Define Application Features: Outline the crypto chatbot functionalities including real-time price checks, historical data access, price alerts, market trends, educational content, and price charts.
- Select a Cryptocurrency API: Choose an API like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap that offers comprehensive cryptocurrency data.
- Setup Version Control: Initialize a Git repository to manage your project's code.
### Step 2: Environment Setup
-Install Node.js and npm: Make sure both are installed for backend development.
-Create Your Project Directory: Organize your project with two main subfolders: client for the React app and server for the Node.js/Express backend.
### Step 3: Front-End Development (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)
-Initialize Vite React App: Create a new React project with Vite and configure it for React.
-Set Up Tailwind CSS: Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling your front-end application.
-Set Up Redux and Socket.IO Client: Install Redux for state management and set up the Socket.IO client for real-time communication.
-Build UI Components: Design and develop UI components for displaying real-time prices, historical data, price alerts, market trends, educational content, and price charts.
-Responsive Design: Ensure your design is responsive and user-friendly on different devices.
### Step 4: Back-End Development (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
-Initialize Express App and Configure Mongoose: Set up your Express server and use Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB.
-Configure dotenv for Environment Variables: Securely manage API keys and other sensitive information using dotenv.
-Implement Socket.IO for Real-Time Communication: Set up Socket.IO on your server for live updates.
-Set Up Axios for API Requests: Use Axios to make HTTP requests to the cryptocurrency API from your backend.
-Develop RESTful API Endpoints: Create endpoints for the different functionalities such as fetching real-time prices, and historical data, setting up price alerts, accessing market trends, and educational content.
### Step 5: Integrating Cryptocurrency API Features
-Real-time Crypto Prices: Implement an endpoint to fetch and return real-time prices using the cryptocurrency API.
-Historical Data: Add functionality to request and serve historical price data for a given cryptocurrency.
-Price Alerts: Create a system for users to set price alerts, store these in MongoDB, and implement a scheduled task to check and notify users.
-Market Trends: Develop functionality to retrieve and display market trends data.
-Educational Content: Integrate educational content into your chatbot, allowing users to query for information.
-Token Price Charts: Use historical data to generate and display price charts on the front end.
### Step 6: Testing
-Implement Testing: Use Jest for backend testing, including Supertest for testing Express routes. Use React Testing Library for testing front-end components.
-Ensure Full Coverage: Aim for comprehensive test coverage across both unit and integration tests.
### Step 7: Deployment
-Choose Hosting Services: Select suitable hosting services for both the frontend and backend components. Consider services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for the front-end, and Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS for the back-end.
-Prepare for Deployment: Build your front-end application for production. Configure environment variables in your deployment environment.
-Deploy: Follow through with the deployment of both frontend and backend parts of your application, ensuring they are properly connected and functional.
##### Additional Considerations
-Security: Implement security best practices, including HTTPS, proper validation of user inputs, and secure storage and usage of API keys.
-Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for your project, detailing setup processes, architecture, and usage instructions.
